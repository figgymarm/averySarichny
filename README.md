# What's the Weather Like ?
My first project that requires the following:
<ul>
  <li>Create an application built with html, css, Javascript &amp; jQuery</li> 
  <li>Have it use an external API to insert data into the DOM.</li>
</ul>
<p>I decided to create a weather app that utilized the data in a creative way. I used
CSS and jQuery to add images and populate data to the application while keeping
the Javascript as clean as possible.</p>

<h3>Changes or bugs I would address: </h3>
<ul>
  <li>Minor bug when changing between sunny days and other cities with different weather. Sometimes it changes, sometimes it does not.</li>
  <li>Would like to add animation to the box that displays the weather data.</li>
  <li>The responsive design isn't perfect when manually changing the browser size.</li>
</ul>
